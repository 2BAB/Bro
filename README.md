A Modularity Solution in Android. Now is on ALPHA.

## Why Modular

Inspired From the topic <From.Containerization.To.Modularity> (Author: Oasis Feng)

- Engineering
  - Enforced decoupling for high-cohesion code.
  - Module-independent(parallel) development and testing
  - Flexible integration, deployment&upgrade

- Product
  - Selective Installation(light-weight initial install)
  - Hybrid-friendly(web&native, mixandmatch)
  - Open to (3rd-party) extensions
